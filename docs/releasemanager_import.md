## releasemanager import

Import Helm release state

### Synopsis


Release Manager Import will retrieve state from the configured
backend and install all exported releases to the current Kubernetes cluster.

We should avoid introducing scenarios where an imported Release Manager release
is configured to write to the same backend path as an existing
Release Manager in a different cluster. If a Release Manager release is stored
in the remote state, and --new-path is not set, this command will fail. If
you're really sure that this is an operation you want to perform (it probably
isn't), you can set --force to ignore safety checks.

Import is designed to fail if a release already exists with the same name as
a stored release. This is by design. If you to overwrite an existing release,
you should delete it first using helm delete --purge.

### Options

```
      --force                 Skip safety checks
      --new-path string       When installing an exported Release Manager release, update the value of --path
      --release-timeout int   The time, in seconds, to wait for an individual Helm release to install (default 300)
```

      --kubecontext string   Use this kube context, otherwise use the default
  -n, --namespace string     Communicate with the instance of Tiller in this namespace (default "kube-system")
